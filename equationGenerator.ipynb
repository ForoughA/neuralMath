    "# Automatic Symbolic Equation Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "*Written by Forough Arabshahi*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the code for the automatic dataset generation scheme presented in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04342) paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation generation approach is based on generating new mathematical identities by performing local random changes to known identities, starting with a small number of axioms from the domain under study. These changes result in identities of similar or higher complexity (equal or larger depth), which may be correct or incorrect, that are valid expressions within a grammar. The grammar and its rules are defined in detail in [section 2.1 of the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04342). In this notebook we choose elementary algebra and trigonometry as the domain under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Possible Equations\n",
    "<a id=\"sec:posEq\"></a>\n",
    "In order to generate a new identity which may be correct or incorrect, we select an equation at random from the set of known equations, and make local changes to it. We randomly select a node in the expression tree, followed by randomly selecting one of the following actions to make the local change to the equation at the selected node:\n",
    "* ShrinkNode: Replace the node, if itâ€™s not a leaf, with one of its children, chosen randomly. \n",
    "* ReplaceNode: Replace the symbol at the node (i.e. the terminal or the function) with another\n",
    "compatible one, chosen randomly.\n",
    "* GrowNode: Provide the node as input to another randomly drawn function f , which then\n",
    "replaces the node. If f takes two inputs, the second input will be generated randomly from\n",
    "the set of terminals.\n",
    "* GrowSides: If the selected node is an equality, either add or multiply both sides with a\n",
    "randomly drawn number, or take both sides to the power of a randomly drawn number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented in a function called *genNegEquation*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Additional Correct Equations\n",
    "In order to generate only correct identities, we follow the same intuition as above, but only replace structure with others that are equal. In particular, we maintain a dictionary of valid statements (mathDictionary) that maps a mathematical statement to another. For example, the dictionary key $x + y$ has value $y + x$. We use this dictionary in our correct equation generation process where we look up patterns from the dictionary. More specifically, we look for keys that match a subtree of the equation then replace that subtree with the pattern of the value of the key. E.g. given input equation $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$, this subtree matching might produce equality $\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$ by finding key-value pair $x + y : y + x$.\n",
