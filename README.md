# Combining Symbolic and Function Evaluation Expressions In Neural Programs

This repository contains the code for this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04342)

File [equationGenerator.ipynb](https://github.com/ForoughA/neuralMath/blob/master/equationGenerator.ipynb) is an iPython notebook that describes the dataset generation method proposed in the paper, and [lstmTreeNotebook.ipynb](https://github.com/ForoughA/neuralMath/blob/master/lstmTreeNotebook.ipynb) contains the code for training over the generated equations.

For a PyTorch implementation or tree-LSTMs and and memory-augmented tree-LSTMs checkout [here](https://github.com/ForoughA/recursiveMemNet)
